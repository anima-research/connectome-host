# WebUI live surgery: rollback, suppression, quiesce, images, operator log

Operator mutations of a **running** resident, from the WebUI, without a
restart. Everything here follows the idiom the offline surgeries use: fork
first, mutate the fork, make the fork the live branch. The parent branch
keeps everything, so "undo" is always `checkout <parent>`.

The agent-framework this host depends on (^0.21.0) provides all of it. The
SPA still feature-detects each affordance from `welcome.features`, so a
bundle against a host without them simply shows none.

## Rollback to a message

Chat view: hover a message → **⏪ roll back** (the row actions sit inside the
row, top-right). Context view: **⏪ roll back to here** on a raw (non-summary)
box, faintly visible until hovered (boxes carry `sourceMessageId`; summaries
do not, so they have no button).

What happens (`framework.rollbackToMessage`): the chronicle is forked at that
message's origin sequence (`branchAt`), the fork — `rollback/<agent>/<ts>` —
becomes the current branch, `_config` is re-materialized, and Discord
messages that left the context get the awareness marker through the durable
outbox exactly as `/undo` does. Nothing is deleted.

The framework refuses while the agent is not idle (`agent-busy`); nothing is
queued. The dialog then offers **Quiesce, then retry**.

## Suppress messages

The row's **⊘ suppress** enters selection mode; tick more rows; the floating
bar's **suppress** opens the confirm. `framework.suppressMessages` forks at the
current head (`suppress/<agent>/<ts>`), redacts the selected messages on the
fork newest-to-oldest (a shard of a body group expands to the whole group —
chronicle refuses to bisect one), and switches. If any removal fails the
agent is put back on the untouched source branch.

Not retroactive over derived state: a message already folded into an
autobiographical summary stays in that summary. Roll back to before it
entered if that matters.

## Quiesce / resume

Header switch (`● serving` / `⏸ quiesced`). Quiesce drains in-flight turns,
then holds every wake (MCPL data planes, heartbeat, timers) while
compression/maintenance keep running; resume re-runs the feasibility gate
and releases the barrier. Both are recorded in the operator log with the
reason you type. Transitions that originate elsewhere (Discord
`host/command`, API) reach the UI through `host:*` traces.

## Images

Transcript frames reduce media to `{kind:'media', mediaType, ref}`; the
browser renders `<img src="/media/<ref>">` lazily and opens a lightbox on
click. `ref` is `<messageId>/<blockIndex>` or `<messageId>/<blockIndex>.<inner>`
for an image nested in a tool result (read_image, cameras, screenshots).
The endpoint resolves that one message's blobs and streams bytes
(`image/*` only, `nosniff`, sandboxed CSP; observer sessions need the
`messages` scope; `?agent=<name>` picks a non-root agent; `?scope=<child>`
proxies to a fleet child via the `media` panel op). Coalesced shard runs carry
no refs (their block indices are synthetic) and keep the type chip.

The Context document already receives the compiled request with base64
inline (it *is* what the model sees), so it renders those directly; the
stripped-image placeholder text stays visible where the strategy dropped one.

## Operator log

`<storePath>/operator-actions.jsonl` (`DATA_DIR/sessions/<id>/`) — one JSON
line per operator mutation:
`at, kind, agent, requester{via,name}, note, params, result | error`. Kinds:
`rollback`, `suppress`, `hide`, `undo-turn`, `redo-turn`, `unstick`, `nudge`,
`settings-update`, `settings-reset`, `settings-cancel-transition`,
`quiesce`, `resume`. Refusals are logged too (with `error`). The branch
panel shows the tail and refreshes on `operator:action` traces. The
chronicle record log remains the authoritative history of *what* changed;
this file records *who/where/why*.

Requester identity from the WebUI is the basic-auth username (`via:
'webui'`) or the observer grant label (`via: 'webui-observer'`; observers
cannot mutate, so they only appear for read requests that fail).

## Wire additions

Client → server: `rollback {messageId, agent?, note?}`, `suppress
{messageIds, agent?, note?}`, `host-quiesce {reason?}`, `host-resume`,
`request-host-mode`, `request-operator-log {limit?}`.
Server → client: `surgery-result`, `host-mode`, `operator-log`;
`welcome.features`, `welcome.hostMode`. After a successful surgery the
server does what `/checkout` does: `branch-changed` + a fresh welcome for
every client.
